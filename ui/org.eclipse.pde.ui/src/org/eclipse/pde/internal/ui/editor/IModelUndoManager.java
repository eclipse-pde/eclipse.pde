/**
 * Classes that implement this interface provide undo/redo
 * capability linked to changes reported by model change
 * providers. Model change events carry sufficient data
 * to be used in an undo/redo stack and reverted to or
 * reapplied after the change.
 * <p>Model undo manager adds itself as a change listener
 * after being connected to the provider. It is expected
 * to stop listening to change events after being disconnected.
 * Changes reported while being connected are kept in the
 * operation stack whose size can be controlled.
 * <p>The part that uses the undo manager is responsible
 * for supplying Undo and Redo action objects for
 * the purpose of controlling their availability.
 * Undo manager should keep track of its current
 * operation stack pointer and adjust Undo/Redo action
 * availability by calling 'setEnabled' on the
 * provided action objects. Implementation of this
 * interface may also opt to modify Undo/Redo action
 * labels in order to better indicate the effect
 * of the operations if selected (for example,
 * 'Undo Delete' instead of 'Undo').
