<h1>Plug-in</h1>

<p>A <strong>plug-in</strong> is used to group your code into a modular, extendable and sharable unit.</p>

<p>Plug-ins are <em>modular</em> as each plug-in contains some portion of code.  The plug-in specifies other plug-ins (or java packages) it requires to be available to run and it also specifies the set of java packages it provides.  An Eclipse based program or <a href="product.htm">product</a> will contain multiple plug-ins, which can be added, replaced or removed to alter the functionality of the program.</p>

<p>Plug-ins are <em>extendable</em> using <a href="extension.htm">extensions and extension points</a>.  A plug-in can provide one or more extension points so other plug-ins can add to the functionality of the plug-in.  A plug-in may also provide extensions to connect to other plug-ins.</p>

<p>Plug-ins are <em>sharable</em>.  A plug-in can be exported as a directory or as a jar which can be added to other applications.  Plug-ins can be grouped into <a href="feature.htm">features</a> which can be distributed and installed into applications.</p>

<p>Eclipse plug-ins are based on OSGi bundles.  OSGi is used to manage the plug-ins in an Eclipse application.  A plug-in must contain a manifest file with valid OSGi headers for plug-in name and version.  Extensions and extension points functionality added by Eclipse in addition to OSGi.  To use extensions you must provide a plugin.xml file.  PDE provides a full featured <a href="../guide/tools/project_wizards/new_plugin_project.htm">project</a> and <a href="../guide/tools/editors/manifest_editor/editor.htm">editor</a> for creating and editing these files.</p>

<p>Eclipse plug-ins can also be packaged as a Java modular project ( Java 9 or later).</p>
