<h1>Product</h1>

<p>An Eclipse based <strong>product</strong> is a stand-alone program built with the
Eclipse platform.  A product may optionally be packaged and delivered as one or more
<a href="feature.htm">features</a>, which are simply groupings of plug-ins that are 
managed as a single entity by the Eclipse update mechanisms.</p>

<p>Products include all the code and plug-ins needed to run them. This
includes a Java runtime environment (JRE) and the Eclipse platform code.
The plug-in code, JRE, and Eclipse platform are typically installed with a
product-specific installation program. Product providers are free to use
any installation tool or program that is appropriate for their needs. </p>

<p>Once installed, the user launches the product and is presented with an
Eclipse workbench configured specifically for the purpose supported by the
product, such as web development, C++ program development, or any other
purpose. The platform makes it easy to configure labels, about dialogs,
graphics, and splash screens, so that the user has no concept of a platform
workbench, but instead views the workbench as the main window of the product
itself.</p>

<p>PDE provides a <a href="../guide/tools/file_wizards/new_product_config.htm">product 
configuration</a> file and associated <a href="../guide/tools/editors/product_editor/editor.htm">editor</a>
to make it easy to create products in the correct format.</p>
