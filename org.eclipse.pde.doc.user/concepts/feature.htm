<h1>Feature</h1>

<p>A <strong>Feature</strong> is used to package a group of plug-ins together into a single installable and updatable unit.</p>

<p>Features have a manifest that provides basic information
about the feature and its content. Content may include plug-ins, fragments and
any other files that are important for the feature. A feature can also include other features.
The delivery format for a feature is a JAR, but each included plug-in will be provided as a separate JAR.</p>

<p>Once you have created your plug-ins and fragments you can create a new feature 
by creating a <a href="../guide/tools/project_wizards/new_feature_project.htm">New Feature Project</a>.</p>

<p>You can also create <a href="../guide/tools/project_wizards/new_feature_patch.htm">Feature Patches</a> in PDE.  A feature patch is developed in the same fashion as a normal feature, but is used to edit an existing feature rather than create a new one.</p>
