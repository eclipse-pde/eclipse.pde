<h1>Feature Overview</h1>
<p>The <strong>Overview</strong> page serves a dual purpose:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It contains two main sections that define important properties of the feature: <strong>General Information</strong> and <strong>Supported Environments</strong>.</li>
  <li>It functions as a quick reference on how to define, export and publish a feature by providing the <strong>Feature Content</strong>, <strong>Exporting</strong> and <strong>Publishing</strong> sections. These sections provide hyperlinks that, when clicked, navigate to other pages or invoke commands. </li>
</ol>

<h2>General Information </h2>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/overview_general.png" alt="Feature Overview" > </p>
<p>An<strong> ID</strong> is mandatory and must comply with the <a href="../../../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/plugin_manifest.html">specifications</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong>Version</strong> is mandatory and must be of the form <em>major.minor.</em><em>micro.qualifier</em> (e.g. 1.3.0). </p>
<p>A <strong>Name</strong> is the translatable presentation name of the feature. This field is required. </p>
<p>A <strong>Vendor</strong> is the translatable name of the feature vendor. This field is optional. </p>
<p>A <strong>Branding   Plug-in</strong> stores branding information for primary features. If not explicitly set, Eclipse will assume that the branding plug-in   has the same identifier as the feature.</p>
<p>The <strong>Update Site URL</strong> denotes a URL that is used by the installer when searching for feature updates.</p>
<p>The <strong>Update Site Name</strong>  is the human-readable label of the referenced update site. </p>
<p align="left" class="style2">Supported Environments</p>
<p>By default, your feature is treated as universally portable. You can add   constraints by providing supported <strong>Operating Systems</strong>, <strong>Window Systems</strong>, <strong>Languages</strong> and/or   <strong>System Architectures</strong>. This information will be used to ensure that your feature   is not installed or shown in the context that does not match these constraints.</p>
