<h1>Feature Information</h1>
<p>The main purpose of the <strong>Feature Information</strong> page is to specify information that is required to install the feature. </p>

<h2>Feature Description</h2>
<p>A <strong>Feature Description</strong> is a brief component description. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/information_description.png" alt="Description"></p>
<p>Typically, a description is plain text and intended to be translated. Alternatively, you can provide the description in HTML format and point to it via a URL. The URL can be specified as   absolute or relative. If a relative URL is specified, it is assumed to be relative to (and packaged   in) the feature archive. </p>

<h2>Copyright Notice </h2>
<p>The feature <strong>Copyright Notice</strong> is typically provided as plain text and is intended to be translated. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/information_copyright.png" alt="Copyright"></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can provide the copyright notice in HTML format and point to it via a URL. The URL can be specified as   absolute or relative. If a relative URL is specified, it is assumed to be relative to (and packaged   in) the feature archive. </p>

<h2>License Agreement</h2>
<p>The <strong>License Agreement</strong> is a feature <em>click-through</em> license. It is typically  simple text and is intended to be translated. </p>
<p>The license is   displayed in a standard dialog with <strong>Accept</strong> and <strong>Reject</strong> actions during the   download and installation process. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/information_license.png" alt="License"></p>
<p>Note that a <em>click-through</em> license must be   specified for any feature that will be selected for installation or update within Eclipse. 
When using nested features, only the nesting parent   (i.e. the feature selected for installation or update) must have <em>click-through</em> license <strong>Text</strong> defined. </p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that the license text is required even if the Optional URL attribute is specified. </strong></em></p>

<h2>Sites to Visit</h2>
<p><strong>Sites to Visit</strong> specify the name and URL of sites to search for new features. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/information_sites.png" alt="Sites To Visit"></p>
<p>In general, a vendor can use <strong>Sites to Visit</strong> to reference its own site(s), or partner site(s) that offer complementary features. </p>
<p>This data is simply used as a way to distribute new site URLs to the clients. Sites that belong to root features (at the top of the hierarchy) typically appear as <strong>Available Software Sites</strong> within the install wizard. </p>
