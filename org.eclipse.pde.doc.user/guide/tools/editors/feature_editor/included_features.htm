<h1>Included Features </h1>
<p>The <strong>Included Features</strong> section references all features nested inside your feature and their associated properties.</p>

<h2>Feature List</h2>
<p>The <strong>Included Features</strong> list enumerates all the features that are directly nested in your feature. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/features_included.png" alt="Included Features"></p>
<p>When your feature is built, all of its included features are recursively built and packaged as well.</p>

<h2>Included Feature Details</h2>
<p><img src="../../../images/feature_editor/features_details.png" alt="Included Feature Details"></p>
<p>An included feature may be marked as <strong>optional</strong> using the <strong>The feature is optional</strong> option. Users may not choose to install optional features.  However, if users do choose to install optional features, they may safely disable them later on.  Please note that a missing optional feature is not treated as an error.</p>
<p>An included feature can be updated by patches. By default, the installer searches for updates to an included feature at <strong>the update site for the parent feature</strong>; but, this setting can be overridden. </p>
<p>If an included feature contains platform-specific code or resources, then environment conditions should be specified and associated with that feature.</p>
