<h1>Plug-in Runtime</h1>
<p>The <strong>Runtime</strong> page shows all the packages that your   plug-in makes visible to other plug-ins and the libraries and folders that constitute the plug-in runtime classpath. </p>

<h2>Exported Packages </h2>
<p>The <strong>Exported Packages</strong> section lists all packages that your plug-in intends to expose to downstream clients. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/runtime_exported.png" alt="Exported Packages" ></p>
<p>You can set a <strong>Version</strong> on each exported package when you press <strong>Properties...</strong>. The version is of the form <em>major.minor.micro</em> (e.g. 1.3.0).</p>
<p>Press <strong>Add...</strong> to see the list of packages available for export that are not already in your list.</p>
<p>PDE can calculate the <em>uses</em> directive, as defined in the OSGi Specification, for all of your publicly exported packages. Press the <strong>Calculate Uses</strong> button to begin. Because this process involves code introspection, this might be a long running operation.</p>
<p>You can control the visibility of each package to downstream clients in the <strong>Package Visibility</strong> section. Refer to the <a href="access_rules.htm">Access Rules</a> document for full details. </p>
<p>When the visiblity of a package is changed the icon beside the package will change to reflect its status as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/public.svg" alt="Public Package"> Visible to all downstream plug-ins (public)</li>
<li><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/internal.svg" alt="Internal Package"> Not visible to any downstream plug-ins (internal)</li>
<li><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/xfriend.svg" alt="X-Friend Package"> Visible to a specific list of downstream plug-ins (internal with friends)</li>
</ul>

<a name="classpath"></a>
<h2>Classpath</h2>
<p>The <strong>Classpath</strong> section lists all the locations the runtime will search when loading classes from this plug-in. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/plugin_editor/runtime_classpath.png" alt="Classpath" ></p>
<p><em><strong>Since JAR'd plug-ins are the recommended format for Eclipse 3.1 and up built plug-ins, it is recommended to leave this section blank.</strong></em></p>
<p>Press <strong>New...</strong> to add the name of a library that has not been built yet.</p>
<p>Press <strong>Add...</strong> to browse the current plug-in project and add an existing JAR or folder to the classpath.</p>
<p>The order of the table entries dictate the class loading order; therefore, use the <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons to organize your classpath accordingly.</p>
