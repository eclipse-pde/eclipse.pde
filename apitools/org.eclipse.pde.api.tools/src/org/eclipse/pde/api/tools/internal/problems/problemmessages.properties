#version number problems
5 = The major version should be incremented in version {0}, since API breakage occurred since version {1}
6 = The major version should be the same for version {0}, since no API breakage occurred since version {1}
7 = The minor version should be incremented in version {0}, since new APIs have been added since version {1}
56 = The minor version should be the same for version {0}, since no new APIs have been added since version {1}
19 = The major version should be incremented in version {0}, because the modification of the version range for the re-exported bundle {1} requires a major version change
20 = The minor version should be incremented in version {0}, because the modification of the version range for the re-exported bundle {1} requires a minor version change
