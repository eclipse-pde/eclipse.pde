# Example .apiconfig file for Eclipse API Tools
# This file configures how version increments are handled for OSGi bundles

# Version Increment Rules
# -----------------------
# Format: <segment>.version.increment = <target_segment>+<amount>
# Where:
#   - segment: major, minor, or micro
#   - target_segment: major, minor, or micro (which segment to actually increment)
#   - amount: positive integer (how much to increment by)

# Example: Eclipse Platform doesn't use major version increments
# When a major change is detected, increment minor version instead
major.version.increment = minor+1

# Standard minor version increment
minor.version.increment = minor+1

# Micro version increments by 100 (common pattern for service releases)
micro.version.increment = micro+100


# Error Handling Mode
# -------------------
# Format: <segment>.version.error = error|warning|ignore|filter
# Where:
#   - error: Report as error (default)
#   - warning: Report as warning
#   - ignore: Don't report
#   - filter: Automatically create an API filter with comment

# Auto-generate filters for major version problems
# (useful when you've decided your policy doesn't use major versions)
major.version.error = filter

# Report minor version issues as errors (default behavior)
minor.version.error = error

# Report micro version issues as warnings
micro.version.error = warning
